        <h3 style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul style="margin-right: 5px">
            <li>2 C gluten free flour</li>
            <li>1/4 C sugar (reduce by 1 tbsp if using blueberries)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 C cold, unsweetened coconut milk or any other plant milk (the more fat it has, the better)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 C roughly chopped fresh cranberries, or dried blueberries</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (one orange worth) zest (or zest of one lemon, if using blueberries)</li>
            <li>8 tbsp shortening (or butter)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">Instructions</h3>
        <ol style="margin-right: 5px">
            <li>Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl: 
                <ul>
                    <li>2 C gluten free flour (you can use up to 1 C of almond meal/flour--it will make the dough very soft, making these "drop" scones rather than "cut" scones)</li>
                    <li>1/4 C sugar (reduce by 1 TBSP if using blueberries)</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine wet ingredients in a large measuring cup or a smallish bowl:
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 C cold, unsweetened coconut milk or any other plant milk (the more fat it has, the better)</li>
                    <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                    <li>1/2 C roughly chopped fresh cranberries, or dried blueberries</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp (one orange worth) zest (or zest of one lemon, if using blueberries)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Start preheating the oven at 400F.  (If it's the kind that takes forever to preheat, you'd want to start this sooner)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add 8 TSBP shortening (or butter) into the dry bowl. (if you want it to be the cut type of scones, be sure to use very cold butter/shortening) TIP: cut the shortening/butter into thin--no more than 1/4 inch thick--strips so that it'd be easy to combine it with the flour mix. You can use a folk, a pastry cutter, knives... different people swear by different tools.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When the flour and shortening/butter is combined well enough that a large part of the mixture looks like little peas or rice <br>grains (for me, there's always some flour, more than a TBSP for sure, that isn't blended with the shortening, but you've had the scones and you wouldn't know, would you?), pour the wet ingredients in.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If the dough is very wet and sticky, you might opt for "drop" scones-- just like you would with the cookie dough, you can pour large spoonfuls onto the prepared (lined) sheet.  Pop the sheet into the oven.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If it is somewhat solid but sticky, lay wax paper on the counter. You can grease it, or (my choice) pour some almond flour onto it, then turn the dough out onto it.  Pour some more almond flour onto the top of the dough, then cover it with another piece of wax paper, then pat the dough to flatten it to about 1/2 inch thick. OR... if you don't mind getting your hands sticky, you can skip the <br>wax paper and just pat the dough down with your hands.  TIP: use the wax paper underneath the dough to shape the edges and corners of the dough (hold the paper up a bit to define the edges, then press the dough into semi-uniform thickness).  Cut the dough into whatever shape you want--triangle, rectangle, large, small.... the larger the pieces, the longer they take to bake.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Check on them at 18 minutes if the pieces are small, 20 minutes if they're large (12 rectangles, for example). They are done when the edges are beginning to turn golden brown.</li>
